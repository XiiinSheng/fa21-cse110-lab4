## Question 4
ReferenceError: result is not defined  
This is because `let` can only be accessed within the `if` block, so outside the block in `line 13` it's not defined anymore. 

## Question 5
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.  
This is because we assigned result to 0 and it can't be changed anymore. In line 7 when we try to reassign a new value to it, we get an error. 

## Question 6
ReferenceError: result is not defined  
(When running the complete block of code, only the error in line 7 will be printed.)  
This is because `const` can only be accessed within the `if` block, so outside the block in `line 13` it's not defined anymore.
