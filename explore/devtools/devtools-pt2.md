# DevTools Part-2 Answers

## Question 1 
`num1` and `num2` are stored and passed as `Strings`, so `calculateSum` just concatenates the Strings instead of adding up the numbers. 

## Question 2 
I would convert both of the strings to number using `Number()` in `calculateSum` before summing up the numbers.
